# R-Pi Sensors
A set of software tools for collecting sensor data on the Raspberry Pi. I use these for my own research, which I will be publishing in a separate github repo at a later date.

The Cpp_Tools folder contains drivers for RPi I2C, the HMC6343 magnetometer, and the MPU-6050 inertial measurement unit, along with programs for logging data from each one.

The Python_Tools folder contains scripts for reading serial data, which I created specifically to timestamp and save data from a Sparkfun Razor IMU and a NovAtel GPS.
